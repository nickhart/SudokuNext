# Sudoku

Copyright Nicholas Hart 2023

## Overview

Started with an example React tic-tac-toe app, converted it to typescript, turned it into a sudoku game, and then:

- ability to switch between a 4x4 and 9x9 grid
- added tailwindcss and cleaned up css

## TODO

- templates (enabled partially-filled games)
- hover states--disable if not clickable
- more color palattes?
- show conflicts/errors/contraints?
- annotations
- hints
- auto-play (via correct annotations)
