**This is the first NextJS project I created.** I borrowed a simple JS/React Tic Tac Toe app,
converted it to Typescript, upgraded it to use NextJS, then mostly rewrote it with an updated
model, Board, Cell, and Game components in order to make a Sudoku game--while still preserving
the ability to go back to a previous state (which seems kinda handy for a Sudoku game that
doesn't prevent one from making an incorrect move).

As an experiment one can switch to a 4x4 grid which is pretty trivial to solve, but I
thought it would be interesting and possibly make it easy to test.

I used [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com) to help update dependencies, do some project cleanup,
and make the README a little spiffier. **But the code was 100% human.** Before Cursor it would
take a lot of googling to solve minor issues with various module and project configuration
problems. In the span of an hour it took my 15 month old project and brought it up to date! ðŸš€

## Overview

Started with an example React tic-tac-toe app, converted it to typescript, turned it into a sudoku game, and then:

- ability to switch between a 4x4 and 9x9 grid
- added tailwindcss and cleaned up css

## TODO

- templates (enabled partially-filled games)
- hover states--disable if not clickable
- more color palattes?
- show conflicts/errors/contraints?
- annotations
- hints
- auto-play (via correct annotations)
